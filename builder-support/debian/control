Package: wforce
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Daemon for detecting brute force attacks
 The goal of 'wforce' is to detect brute forcing of passwords across many
 servers, services and instances. In order to support the real world, brute
 force detection policy can be tailored to deal with "bulk, but legitimate"
 users of your service, as well as botnet-wide slowscans of passwords.
 The aim is to support the largest of installations, providing services to
 hundreds of millions of users.

Package: wforce-trackalert
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Longterm abuse data reporting and alerter
 Trackalert is designed to be an optional service to complement
 wforce. Whereas wforce provides a toolkit to combat  abuse of
 logins such as password brute forcing in realtime, trackalert is
 designed to look at abuse asynchronously, using long-term report data
 stored in an external DB such as elasticsearch, and to send alerts on
 potential login abuse.
