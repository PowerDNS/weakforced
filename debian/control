Description: Daemon for detecting brute force attacks
 The goal of 'wforced' is to detect brute forcing of passwords across many
 servers, services and instances. In order to support the real world, brute
 force detection policy can be tailored to deal with "bulk, but legitimate"
 users of your service, as well as botnet-wide slowscans of passwords.
 The aim is to support the largest of installations, providing services to
 hundreds of millions of users.
