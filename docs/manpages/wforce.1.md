# NAME
**wforce** - daemon to detect brute-force login attempts and enforce other policies for logins

# SYNOPSIS
wforce [*OPTION*]... 

# DESCRIPTION
**wforce** implements a simple HTTP server that accepts JSON formatted commands 
that report successful/unsuccessful logins and query whether a login should be 
allowed to proceed. 

**wforce** can act as both a client and server. As a server it typically runs
under systemd control, although it can also be run as a traditional daemon
or in 'interactive' mode. As a client, it connects to a wforce server and
provides the same interactive commands.

**wforce** is scriptable in Lua, see the wforce.conf file for a simple example,
and wforce.conf.example for a more sophisticated example. In fact all
configuration is done using the Lua language, as wforce.conf is simply a
Lua script.

# SCOPE
**wforce** depends on the systems performing login authentication to integrate
with it using the HTTP/JSON API. Example clients of the API include Dovecot
and OX AppSuite.

**wforce** provides a simple clustering mechanism through the process of 
configuring "siblings" in wforce.conf. All modifications to the
blacklists or the string stats DB (either from Lua or the REST API)
will be replicated to all configured siblings. Replication uses the
UDP protocol, so if siblings are not on a local subnet, you should
ensure that any firewalls forward UDP on the configured ports.

# OPTIONS
-c 
:    Act as a client, connecting to a wforce instance at the IP/Port 
     specified in the 'controlSocket' function in wforce.conf. A
     custom configuration file can be specified.

-C,--config *FILE*
:    Load configuration from *FILE*.

-s
:    Run in foreground, but do not spawn a console. Use this switch to run
     wforce inside a supervisor (use with e.g. systemd and daemontools).

-d,--daemon
:    Operate as a daemon.

-e,--execute *CMD*
:    Connect to wforce and execute *CMD*.

-h,--help
:    Display a helpful message and exit.

-l,--local *ADDRESS*
:    Bind to *ADDRESS*.

# CONSOLE COMMANDS

The following commands can be run from the console when *wforce* is
started with the -c option.

* makeKey() - Returns a string to be used in the setKey() function in
  wforce.conf to authenticate sibling communications. All siblings
  must be configured with the same key.

		> makeKey()
		setKey("CRK+jKBpzXNLmM2A4C7OpFCBxiwpYlreCWgGEAIKAQI=")


* stats() - Returns statistics about the wforce process. For example:

		> stats()
		40 reports, 8 allow-queries, 40 entries in database

* siblings() - Returns information about configured siblings. For
  example:

		> siblings()
		Address                             Sucesses  Failures     Note
		192.168.1.79:4001                   18        7              
		192.168.1.30:4001                   25        0              
		192.168.1.54:4001                   0         0            Self

* showNamedReportSinks() - Returns information about configured report
  sinks. For example: 

		> showNamedReportSinks()
		Name            Address                             Sucesses  Failures
		trackalert      192.168.1.79:4501                   18        0
		trackalert      192.168.1.30:4501                   19        0
		elasticsearch   10.22.2.15:4501                     18        0
		elasticsearch   10.22.2.16:4501                     19        0

* showReportSinks() - Deprecated - use showNamedReportSinks() instead. Returns
  information about configured report sinks. For example:

		> showReportSinks()
		Address                             Sucesses  Failures
		192.168.1.79:4501                   18        7
		192.168.1.30:4501                   25        0

* showStringStatsDB() - Returns information about configured stats
  databases. For example:

		> showStringStatsDB()
		DB Name              Win Size/No Max Size  Cur Size  Field Name       Field Type
		MyDB1                1/15        524288    0         countLogins      int
		                                                     diffPasswords    hll
		MyDB2                600/6       5000      2093      diffIPs          hll

# BUGS
The replication function of clustering means that as more servers are added to a 
cluster, incremental performance gains may be less each time, eventually
possibly leading to peformance degradation. This is because each
server keeps a full copy of the stats DBs and the blacklists, and
changes to those are replicated to all siblings. This can be mitigated by
partitioning siblings into smaller clusters that do not share
information, at the expense of missing potential abuse activity.
