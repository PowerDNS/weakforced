# Release Notes for OX Abuse Shield 2.10.2

<!-- {% raw %} -->

## Improvements

* Fixed LuaState selection algorithm to use a free pool, which should lead to faster/more consistent selection of lua states by threads.

* `powerdns/wforce-minimal` image is now available, using alpine for more secure and much smaller image than the existing debian-based image.
